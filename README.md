# typescript-dsa

Repository for implementations for a good number of data structures and algorithms in TypeScript

# Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome :) 

### If you want to add your own implementation of a data structure or algorithm:
- Fork the repository
- Create a folder in the relevant directory (`data_structures` or `algorithms`) w/ name in snake_case
- Inside this folder, add your implementation w/ the file name(s) in PascalCase
  - For a data structure, implement it as a class
  - For an algorithm, implement it as a function
  - Export the relevant class(es)/function(s)
- Write tests in the `tests` directory
- After testing, make a pull request

Changes to pre-existing implementations are also welcome :]

### If you find a typo in documentation:
This repo uses typedoc to generate documentation from JSDoc comments, so please fix typos directly in the code. Then submit a pull request.
